  Provides an environment for multithreaded FastCGI programs in Java.
  The underlying transport is set outside the program, so it can be
  switched between Unix- and Internet-domain sockets, or be called by
  a reverse proxy.

  <p>
    If you're concerned merely with application logic of responding to
    requests, you only need to concern yourself with {@link
    uk.ac.lancs.fastcgi} and {@link uk.ac.lancs.fastcgi.context}.
    These define the role types and their contexts.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're writing an application, you need classes from {@link
    uk.ac.lancs.fastcgi.transport} to work out how to receive
    transport connections from the server.  You'll also need {@link
    uk.ac.lancs.fastcgi.engine}, whose classes translate between
    transport connections and your role implementations.  The choice
    of engine determines what roles you support, and the degree of
    concurrency permitted.

    Alternatively, you can run {@link
    uk.ac.lancs.fastcgi.app.FastCGIApplication} as an application, and
    it will determine engine configuration from command-line
    arguments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other packages provide implementations of transports and engines,
    and will likely be of use only to those providing their own
    implementations.
